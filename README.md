# Advent of Code 2020

For my first ever time participating in the yearly Advent of Code, I decided to use Haskell for all of my solutions!

## Execution Environment

For all of these problems, I used GHC `8.10.2` and Cabal `3.2.0.0` installed globally with `ghcup`.

## How to Use

All solutions are meant to be runnable as scripts, expecting input on `stdin`. Call them like so: `./partX.hs < input > output` to obtain the output in a file.
