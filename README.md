# Advent of Code 2020

For my first ever time participating in the yearly Advent of Code, I decided to use Haskell for all of my solutions!

## Execution Environment

For all of these problems, I used GHC `8.10.2` and Cabal `3.2.0.0` installed globally with `ghcup`.

Some solutions require additional libraries to `base`. These are (along with their versions as of the time of writing):

* `containers 0.6.2.1`
* `regex-tdfa 1.3.1.0`
* `split 0.2.3.4`

## How to Use

All solutions are meant to be runnable as scripts, expecting input on `stdin`. Call them like so: `./partX.hs < input > output` to obtain the output in a file.
